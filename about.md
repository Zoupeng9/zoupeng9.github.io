My name is Peng Zou. I come from Sinan county, Guizhou province, southwest China. 
Since September 2015, I'm a master student major in geophysics in Tongji university. 
My supervisor is Prof. Jiubing Cheng, of [Reflection Seimic Group](http://mgg.tongji.edu.cn/space/rsg/main.psp) 
in [School of Ocean and Earth Science](http://mgg.tongji.edu.cn). 
Before that I'm a bachelor student in the same department of Tongji university.

The main work of my ordinary research is using the seimic data to interprete the underground 
strata structure and rock's physical properties. My research interests including computational 
seismology, anisotropic media forward modelling and migration, visco- acoustic/elastic waveform 
inversion and multiscale tomography. I'm the student member of 
[Society of Exploration Geophysicists](http://seg.org/) and 
[European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers](http://eage.org/).

After work, I love sports very much (basketball, badminton, table tennis, running and cricket).
I'm also like puzzle games (poker, Chinese chess and mahjong). 
    
My mother tongue is Chinese, however, I will try to write some of my posts in English. But it depends. 
Due to my limited ability, mistakes are inevitable in the posts and I am not responsible for the 
corresponding consequences. If you have any suggestions about the technical content or my English 
skills, let me know, please.
